    "1. Implement the interface `ComparableSorter `which specifies the following method: `public void sort(Comparable[] array)` This method receives an array of objects that implement the `Comparable` interface and sorts it according to the definition of the `compareTo` method defined in the class.\n",
    "2.  Implement the class `ComparableBubbleSorter`, which implements the `ComparableSorter` using the bubble `sort` algorithm in its sort method. You must look for a Java/Python implementation of this algorithm, and adapt it so that it uses the `compareTo` method specified within `Comparable` interface. \n",
    "3. Implement the class `ComparableDirInsertSorter`, which implements the `ComparableSorter` using the direct insertion sort algorithm in its sort method. You must look for a Java/Python implementation of this algorithm, and adapt it so that it uses the `compareTo` method specified within `Comparable` interface. \n",
    "4.  Implement the class `Building`, with two private attributes, one indicating its volume, and another indicating its height. Makes that this class implements the `Comparable` interface in such a way that the method `compareTo` indicates whether the volume of this building is greater, equal, or less than the volume of the building passed as argument.\n",

    "NOTE: the Comparable interface is defined in the Java standard distribution. Take a look to it.\n"
